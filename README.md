# El-Milagro
In this project, I have added image upload options in the customizer, implemented custom background images for pages, repositioned navigation menus, added WooCommerce support, and created custom shortcodes. I also modified product pages, tabs, and stock displays, and optimized the blog layout with custom widgets and breadcrumb management.
